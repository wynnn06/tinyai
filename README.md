# Table Driven Lexer

This project implements a table-driven lexer that combines multiple regular expressions (regex) into a single epsilon-NFA (e-NFA), converts it to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and tests the matching functionality against various input strings.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code files.
  - **main.cpp**: Entry point of the application.
  - **regex_parser.hpp**: Header file for the regex lexer and parser.
  - **regex_parser.cpp**: Implementation of the regex lexer and parser.
  - **nfa.hpp**: Header file for the NFA representation.
  - **nfa.cpp**: Implementation of the NFA functionality.
  - **dfa.hpp**: Header file for the DFA representation.
  - **dfa.cpp**: Implementation of the DFA functionality.
  - **engine.hpp**: Header file for combining regex patterns. UNUSED.
  - **engine.cpp**: Implementation of the regex combination logic. UNUSED.

**ALL INCLUDE CONTENTS ARE UNUSED**
- **include/**: Contains public interface headers for the lexer.

- **Makefile**: Defines build commands for the project.

## Building the Project

To build the project, you can use either CMake or Make. 

### Using CMake

1. Create a build directory:
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

2. Run CMake to configure the project:
   ```
   cmake ..
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```
   make
   ```

### Using Make

Simply run:
```
make
```

## Running the Application

After building the project, you can run the application by executing the compiled binary. The application will combine the specified regex patterns into a single e-NFA, convert it to a DFA, and test various input strings for matches.

## Testing

To run the tests, navigate to the `tests` directory and use CMake to build and run the tests:
```
cd tests
cmake .
make
./test_regex
```
